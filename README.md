# TSP_Scripts
Some scripts for extracting geometric properties of Travelling Salesperson Graphs using R. For example:

Find intersections:
The script helps detect intersections in TSP solutions. By setting a parameter to true, the script will highlight them as well. Either way it returns a list of intersection points.

Find area:
The area of the solution affects both the aesthetic appeal, and the perceived optimality. However, areas of irregular shapes with crossings are difficult to calculate. This script
is still under construction, but ultimately will use monte-carlo to calculate the area of the irregular solutions.
